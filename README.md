# Color Detection with OpenCV

This project implements a color detection tool using OpenCV and Python. It allows users to upload an image and identify the RGB values of colors at specific points by clicking with the mouse on the image.

## Features

- Upload an image and display it in a graphical interface.
- Click on any point in the image to detect the color at that location.
- Display the RGB values of the detected color in real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` Python library)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awaisnazir08/Color-Detection-Opencv
   ```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

```bash
cd Color-Detection-Opencv
```

## Run the file

``` bash
python color_detection.ipynb
```

## Example

In this example, an image is loaded into the graphical interface, and the user clicks on various points to detect the colors at those locations.
